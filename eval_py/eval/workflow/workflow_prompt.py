    """I need a deep news briefing on the US–China trade war and tariffs.

Use the DuckDuckGo MCP server from Obot (no configuration needed). Connect to it and use both tools: search and fetch_content.

**Phase 1 — Search (up to 5 searches)**  
Run up to 5 DuckDuckGo searches, each with max_results=10. Use these queries if possible:
- US-China trade war tariffs latest news 2025
- US-China trade war tariffs analysis
- US-China trade war impact
- US China tariffs trade
- China United States trade war

If a search returns 0 results, try a shorter query (e.g. "US China tariffs", "trade war news") or skip. If you still get no results from search, use fetch_content on at least one known URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war (and any other relevant URLs you know). The goal is to have at least 2–3 sources to read.

**Phase 2 — Source selection**  
From the search results (or the fallback URL above), pick up to 6 URLs. Prefer diversity and substance. If you have fewer than 6, that is OK—use what you have.

**Phase 3 — Deep reading**  
Use fetch_content on each chosen URL (max 6). If a fetch fails, skip and continue. Stop after you have successfully loaded content from at least 2 sources. Do not keep fetching indefinitely.

**Phase 4 — Cross-reference**  
From the content you loaded, note: confirmed facts (2+ sources), conflicting or single-source claims, and key data points (stats, dates, quotes).

**Phase 5 — Final report (required)**  
You MUST produce the final report now. Do not fetch more sources. Do not add more tool calls. Write a single report with exactly these sections (use markdown headings):

## US–China Trade War Briefing

### Confirmed facts (2+ sources)
(2–4 sentences on facts that appear in multiple sources)

### Conflicting or single-source claims
(1–3 sentences on disagreements or unverified claims, if any)

### Key data points
(Stats, dates, or quotes that matter)

### Note on sources
(Which URLs/sources you used; if any fetch failed, say so briefly)

Then stop. Your reply must end with this report."""
